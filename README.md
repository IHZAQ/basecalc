# Simple Base Calculator

This is just a fun tools made by me instead of normal scientific calculator which only had 4 base:
1. 10(DEC)
2. 16(HEX)
3. 2(BIN)
4. 8(OCT)

So this had full 2-16.
If you want to use it, you can either 
1. Download the html, css, and javascript file in `src` folder 
2. Visit the [website](https://sc.ihzaq.revo.gay/base) I host
3. You can install the app  [basecalc.apk](/basecalc.apk) so you can use it even if its offline
