# Simple Base Calculator

This is just a fun tools made by me instead of normal scientific calculator which only had 4 base:
1. 10(DEC)
2. 16(HEX)
3. 2(BIN)
4. 8(OCT)

So this had full 2-16.
If you want to use it, you can either download the html, css, and javascript file in `src` folder or you can just install the [basecalc.apk](/basecalc.apk) file directly in your phone.
